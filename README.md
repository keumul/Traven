# Traven
## Traven is a project which is done on WPF with usage of MS SQL database
### The application used:
+ Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Integrated Development Environment;
+ .NET Framework 4.7.2;
+ C# programming language;
+ XAML;
+ WPF technology;
+ Entity Framework technology;
+ Microsoft SQL Server
### The pattern used is MVVM

### The modern world is a continuous stream of information. And often, it is very difficult to isolate a rational grain in this information. And what would it be like if all the information was laid out on the shelves, in a simple and obvious form.
### In fact, there is a way to highlight the necessary information and it is called MindMaps.
### MindMaps is a graphical scheme that helps to visually structure any information. MindMaps looks like a diagram or diagram, in the center of which there is a block with the main theme, goal or main idea. This block is divided into several additional branches in which you can describe associations, ideas or tasks.
### You can use MindMaps in any sphere of life:
### – At work. Graphs and diagrams in MindMaps help you see the entire scope of work at once and divide tasks into urgent and non-urgent. During the brainstorming session, all thoughts and ideas are fixed on MindMaps. Then you can choose the most successful ones and implement them.
### – During training. To memorize new complex information, you need to write on a piece of paper or in an electronic version of the map all the thoughts that come to mind on the main topic. You can even color each branch in different colors and add images or original symbols. The brain assimilates visual information and images well, so it will be much easier for us to remember the material this way. By the way, a study by David Bowley from Johns Hopkins University confirms: people who use MindMaps when they study have 12% higher rates than those who do not use this tool.
### – In the planning of everyday affairs. MindMaps is what helps you plan things. With it, it is easy to make a daily work schedule, organize a trip to another city or a business conference.
### *When writing this project, one of the tasks was a simple and accessible design for both users with a technical education and ordinary users.*
